It easily fits in any tool belt, and its lightweight design promotes easy one-handed operation and minimal fatigue on all-day jobs. The optimized handle with Elastomer wrap provides additional comfort and a secure grip.</><strong>Powerful Enough to Tackle a Wide Range of Applications</strong><br />Though small, the DB10DL is able to generate enough power to handle a wide range of applications. The DB10DL's powerful motor boasts a maximum of 88 in./lbs. of torque, so it will make easy work of most light-duty jobs, such as cabinetry work, drilling and fastening.</>The variable-speed trigger allows for precise control over the speed of the drill--between 0 and 400 RPM--and the best-in-class 21+1 stage clutch lets you dial in the perfect amount of torque for the job.</><strong>Specially Designed Chuck for Ease of Use</strong><br />For ease of use, the DB10DL features an LED ring that surrounds the 1/4-inch quick-change chuck and illuminates the work surface, making it easy to use the drill driver in darker work areas. The chuck requires no tools for bit changes--simply pull out, insert the bit, and release the chuck.</><strong>HXP Batteries Last Three Times Longer and Weigh 50% Less</strong><br />The DB10DL owes its light weight to two HXP Lithium-Ion batteries (included). These 1.5-Ah batteries weigh half of what traditional NiCd or NiMH batteries weigh. In fact, tools featuring HXP batteries are on average one pound lighter than tools using traditional batteries.</>Additionally, HXP batteries last three times longer than their competition. Where NiCd and NiMH batteries could be used for up to 500 charge cycles, HXP Lithium-Ion batteries can be used for up to 1,500 charge cycles! An added bonus, the included quick charger replenishes the battery power in just 40 minutes, so you have less down time.</>HXP Lithium-Ion batteries operate within optimal voltage limits, protecting both the tool and batteries from damage. Protection circuitry built into the batteries and charger monitors the charge and discharge for each battery cell, resulting in peak operating performance.</>And if a surge in power is detected during use, Hitachi's Over-Current Protection technology will temporarily shut of the power to protect the batteries and tool from being damaged. This feature allows the power to return to optimal voltage, thereby extending battery and tool life beyond any competitive lithium-ion products.</>HXP batteries come with a two-year HXP Lithium-Ion Battery Warranty, which protects against possible defects in materials and workmanship.</><strong>The Industry's Longest Lithium-Ion Tool Warranty</strong><br />Every Hitachi cordless power tool is designed to the highest standards and is rigorously tested for both performance and durability. All HXP Lithium-Ion cordless tools come with a Lifetime Lithium-Ion Tool Warranty, which protects against possible defects in materials and workmanship.</><strong>About Hitachi: A Tradition of Innovation</strong><br />Hitachi Power Tools (Hitachi Koki USA, Ltd.) provides professional-grade power tools for a variety of applications, including woodwork, metalwork, concrete, drilling, cutting, and fastening.

                When water sits inside the water reservoir for too long, it may gain a weird taste. Dispose of the first few glasses and try again.
            </span>,<span class=""a-size-base a-color-secondary"">
                Well water is more likely to contain contaminants than treated water and may need more frequent filter changes.
            </span>,<span class=""a-size-base a-color-secondary"">
                After 6 months, unabsorbed water contaminants and newly formed bacteria can saturate the filter, and could cause contaminants to leak back into the water. If that happens, the water may contain contaminants that the filter is unable to remove.
            </span>,<span class=""a-size-base a-color-secondary"">
                Not changing the filter could reduce the water pressure and make it ineffective. So keep an eye for lower water flow.

B0002JHI1I,Avalon,"Avalon Organics Wrinkle Therapy Cleansing Milk, 8.5 Fluid Ounce. Wrinkle Therapy with CoQ10 &amp; Rosehip, for lines and wrinkles. This Cleansing Milk contains soap-free, botanical cleansers that gently lift away grime without drying or stripping skin.As skin ages and its cellular metabolism slows, collagen and elastin production gradually deteriorates causing wrinkles and sagging. This slowed metabolism is due in part to a decline in the skin's natural levels of Co-Enzyme Q10 and other energy sources. Studies show that supplementing the skin's natural CoQ10 production can help reverse and prevent these visible signs of aging. Wrinkle Therapy features a carefully selected blend of powerful natural wrinkle fighters. CoQ10 will boost skin energy levels to encourage regrowth of collagen and elastin; Rosehip Oil, high in potent antioxidants, provides intense free radical defense and promotes healthy skin rejuvenation; Hyaluronic Acid helps skin attract and retain moisture, resulting in a dewy, resilient and smoother surface texture. When skin is re-energized and its natural defenses are reinforced, it becomes firmer and more elastic, the appearance of lines and wrinkles fade and its overall complexion appears more youthful and healthy. Avalon Organics is grounded in the knowledge that all beauty begins within the Earth. Guided by the wisdom of nature, each product is thoughtfully crafted for optimal effectiveness while meeting a strict organic standard. Formulas contain carefully selected botanicals that are nurtured by the elements then tenderly harvested to nourish the body from the outside in. Deep rooted beauty is at the heart of the Avalon Organics Guiding Principles  ensuring that every product reflects a deep reverence for the planet and all it provides and contributes in its own small way to a holistic lifestyle of health, wellness and sustainability.</></>",,"Avalon Organics Wrinkle Therapy CoQ10 Cleansing Milk, 8.50 oz",8.27,100,All Beauty,5.0

Known as Castile soap, our base is one of the gentlest and moisturizing of all soaps. We employ the ""cold processing"" method and do not add heat or chemicals to the soap pots. This process produces a bar full of natural glycerin, which is a by-product of the soap making process. Unlike most soaps on the market today, we do not remove this glycerin from our soap because it is a humectant, which helps attract moisture to the skin and can be gentle enough for even the driest and most sensitive of skin.

B00009J5VW,,"Nokia&#146;s cutting-edge 3650 phone delivers some impressive features at a reasonable price. This mobile comes in the familiar slim Nokia package (5.10 by 2.24 by 1.00 inches) but has an unusual circular, clock-like keypad design and a full 4,096-color display. The most notable features on the Nokia 3650 are the camera and video capabilities. A built-in digital VGA camera captures photos at a resolution of 640 x 480 and stores up to 1,000 photos at basic resolution on its 16 MB memory card. An incorporated video recorder lets users make short video clips of up to 95 kB of memory using H.263 video inside a 3GP file format and recording at a rate of 15 fps. Users can play back recorded video or downloaded video clips and movie trailers on the Nokia 3650&#146;s RealOne video player. The 3650&#146;s Bluetooth and infrared connections let users exchange photos, video audio, and text in either e-mail or MMS with a PC or compatible wireless device. The GPRS connection ensures high-speed data transmission so users have quick access to Internet content via the XHTML browser. The Nokia 3650 also offers Java support for downloading business applications onto this phone.</>For fun, the Nokia 3560 phone has preloaded polyphonic ring tones and wallpapers and changeable covers that are available in various colors. The phone features on this device include voice dialing for up to 25 numbers, an integrated speakerphone, vibrating alert, and the ability to record and send memos, conversations, and sound clips. The phone book, calendar, and to-do list can all be synchronized with a PC using Nokia 3650 PC Suite software. For hearing-impaired customers, the 3650 even offers TTY/TDD (Telecommunication Device for the Deaf) compatibility with the phone adapter. The Li-Ion battery is rated for up to 4 hours of digital talk time and 200 hours of digital standby time.</></>Sporting a large, 4,096-color display screen and an unconventional, rotary-style keypad, we found the sturdy, feature-rich Nokia 3650 cell phone one of the best designed phones on the market, with excellent ease-of-use, crystal-clear reception, and a camera, video camera, and Internet access.</>In our tests, we found that the comfortable rounded base of this 5-inch phone rested easily our palm, and the clever retro button display took only a moment of getting used to. The buttons and disc navigation felt quite durable, with a nice, solid action. Menu navigation involves two thin buttons on the top left and right that allowed us to move in and out of menus; then the standard 4-point clickable disc provided more detailed selection. There's a separate button for the main menu prominently below the disc, and the faux-rotary layout of the number buttons helped keep the navigation buttons out of the way during dialing. The requisite call and hang-up buttons are intuitively marked, and a futuristic-looking blue light shines through the numbers on all the buttons for easy keying in low-light areas.</>The 3560 delivered consistent, excellent reception in a variety of testing environments, including a basement-level room that typically causes trouble with similar phones. The default ring tones were a bit too gentle for their own good; they were hard to hear in busy outdoor environments. The tones that we created using the composing feature, however, were quite audible, even in the midst of lots of noise. The vibrate alert was also quite effective and hard to miss. Nokia has also preloaded a variety of other polyphonic ring tones for alternate use, as well as a voice-dialing feature, which stores 25 numbers and was easy to use.</>Thanks to high-speed GPRS connection, users can access a variety of Web content, such as news, travel information, and entertainment specifically designed for mobile phones via an XHTML browser, which supports pages written in both HTML and WML (Wireless Markup Language). The 3650's calendar, phone book, and to-do list can all be synchronized with a PC using Nokia 3650 PC Suite software. This phone also supports Java for downloading business applications, and built-in Bluetooth and infrared connections empower users to send photos and text in either e-mail or MMS format to a PC or to another compatible wireless device. Some of the downloadable Java and Symbian applications provided by Nokia through their website include Merriam-Webster Word Search, and games like Racing Fever, Avant Go, and Terminator.</>The phone's digital VGA camera is cleverly built in to the back of phone, and can store up to 1,000 photos at 640 x 480 megapixel resolution on its (upgradeable) 16 MB memory card. Also, the Nokia 3650's photo capability is immediately accessible from the top-level display menu, so unlike other phones it was easy to snap a photo at a moment's notice. The camera records images in standard, portrait, and a nighttime mode.</>With the same basic set of controls, RealOne software lets the video recording function capture short, low-fidelity sound and video clips for immediate MP4 video playback on the generous screen or for sending to another Web-enabled user. The 15-frames-per-second video recording rate delivers stuttering, delayed images that look sort of like Neil Armstrong's transmissions from the Moon. We found this all very entertaining, and potentially useful for transmitting small bits of information, but hard to take seriously as a true video recording device.</>Among the scores of additional features on this phone are text messaging templates, where you create a basic message (like ""Let's eat at --- "") then fill in the blank as you wish; a foreign currency and units converter for the jet set crowd, and a ""favorites"" folder to store Web shortcuts and links. For hearing-impaired customers, Nokia even provides TTY/TDD (Telecommunication Device for the Deaf) compatibility. The headset included with this phone is functional, and Li-Ion battery comes rated for up to 4 hours of digital talk and 200 hours of digital standby time. The phone comes with a refreshingly well-written manual. While decorative faceplates and other accessories are available, we found that even without them, the Nokia 3650 is one of the most coolest phones we've ever laid our hands on. <i>--Erik Hammen</i></><b>Pros:</b> <ul></><b>Pros: </b> <ul> <li>Great reception <li>Excellent, intuitive user interface <li>Feature-rich <li>Solid build and large display screen  <li>Fun camera and video features </ul></><b>Cons: </b> <ul> <li>Large phone size to accommodate large display screen <li>Default ring tones a bit quiet. </ul></><b>How We Tested Battery Talk/Standby Time</b></>When reading our reviews, you should view the test results of mobile-phone  battery talk time and standby time as relative information only. Many variables,  including carrier signal strength at your location, signal consistency  (including incoming and outgoing calls), display and ringer settings, and  battery charging methods and history, will affect performance. When handset  manufacturers and mobile phone carriers list talk-time and standby-time ratings,  they usually include disclaimers about variable performance and often refer to  the times they publish as maximum times. Some quote expected battery life  ranges, and in this case you're probably safe to assume you'll experience at  least the minimum rated range. Note that manufacturers of dual-mode digital and  analog handsets publish battery-life rates for both digital and analog modes, as  analog mode consumes much more power than digital mode.</><b>Our Tests:</b> We tested digital-mode talk and standby times with each phone.  Prior to each test, we fully charged the phone's battery according to the  manufacturer's directions. To test digital-phone talk time, we turned the phone  on, established a digital carrier signal, dialed a number in our test lab, and,  when the call rang through, took the receiving phone's handset off the hook.  When all went well, we didn't do anything else except record the time when the  phone died. In a couple of cases, the phones lost the signal and dropped the  calls. If we were right there and could redial, we did so immediately and  continued running the test. Otherwise, we halted the test, recharged the  battery, and started the test over. Assuming consistent carrier-signal strength,  this test should represent best-case talk time. And it's worth noting that  several phones' talk-time performance significantly exceeded the manufacturers'  ratings.</>To test digital-phone standby time, we turned the phone on, established a  carrier signal, and left the phone in standby mode. We checked the phone every  few hours (for what was often days on end) until the phone finally cut out.  Since no outgoing or incoming calls occurred during testing and because the  phone was not moved, this method should represent best-case standby time, again  assuming consistent carrier signal strength.</>",,Test Big Data 3930,0.0,100,Cell Phones,4.6

B0002F7I94,Motorola,"No wires. No limits. Designed to enhance the experience of any Bluetooth technology enabled phone, the Motorola Wireless Headset HS810 also stores information and wirelessly interacts with up to eight different Bluetooth 1.1 compliant devices, including handsets, PDAs and computers.</></>The Motorola HS810 Bluetooth headset makes use of a folding microphone boom design that Motorola jointly developed with GN Netcom a few years ago. While the HS810 might not be the most attractive headset on the market, the folding boom certainly makes it one of the more practical. When the boom is folded, the device is off. When the boom is extended, the headset powers up and immediately connects to the phone - answering any inbound calls in the process. This design makes standby battery life almost a non-issue since you can easily keep the HS810 powered off when you are not actively using it, turning it on only for an actual call. Its battery life is quite good, with my tests coming in at 5.25 hours of talk time. That's quite a good deal if you don't have to worry about the battery draining while it sits on your desk between calls. A light user like me can easily go a week or two between recharges.</>The folding design has another benefit, too. The HS810 is very pocketable when it is folded closed. Nothing sticks out that could easily get damaged or broken while it is in your pocket. When folded up, the HS810 is just barely over 2 inches in length and a bit less than 1.25 inches in width. Considering that it weighs .70oz (19.9g), you will barely notice it at all.</>Of course you need more than a power switch to operate a headset, to which the HS810 offers a call control/multi-purpose button and a pair of volume keys. The multi-purpose button let's you answer and end calls, as well as initiate voice dialing, reject inbound calls, and redial the last number when used with a phone that supports the Hands Free Bluetooth profile. Most every Bluetooth phone on the market today supports this profile.</>The Motorola HS810 can be linked up (or ""paired"") with up to 8 devices at the same time. This means that you can use it with your phone as well as perhaps your desktop PC and a laptop, assuming the computers have compatible Bluetooth adapters that support headset use. This means that you could potentially use your headset with VOIP applications like Skype as well as with games and other functions.</>People will also be able to tell that you are actively using the headset because of the softly pulsating twin Blue LEDs. Unlike many other headsets on the market, the LEDs fade in and out instead of blinking or flashing annoyingly. The same LEDs will let you know when the device has properly been put into pairing mode when you are linking it up with a phone or computer (the default PIN code is ""0000"").</>In terms of audio quality, the Motorola HS810 runs in the middle of the road. The quality is very clear and easy to understand, both inbound and outbound, but it does suffer from a lack of bass sound. The audio is just a bit on the thin side when compared to the best performing headsets on the market. To perhaps make up for that, though, the HS810 offers something much more practical: an amazing ability to resist wind noise. The HS810 is the ideal headset for people that want to have the windows down while driving or who spend a lot of time outdoors. The HS810's maximum volume level should be fine for most situations.</>In short, I highly recommend the Motorola HS810.</><i>--Reviewed by Michael Oryl, editor in chief of www.MobileBurn.com </i></><strong>Pros:</strong><br> <ul> <li>Small, light</li> <li>Comfortable</li> <li>5 hours of talk time</li> <li>No wind noise</li> <li>Can be worn on both ears</li> </ul></><strong>Cons:</strong><br> <ul> <li>A bit funny looking</li> <li>Audio quality is a bit thin</li> </ul></><strong>What's in the box:</strong> Motorola HS810 Bluetooth Headset, Travel Charger, User Manual, and Quick Start Guide.","Bluetooth wireless technology means that the sheer convenience of hands-free communication is enhanced with total freedom of movement.,Unfold the boom microphone, place the headset over the ear and a link will be established automatically.,This universal accessory encourages users to update, change and evolve because it is compatible with all other 1.1 compliant Bluetooth wireless technology phones by Motorola and other manufacturers.,Smaller Size, Bigger Power.

When the phone is closed, its external screen (two lines, 96 x 32 pixelss) displays caller ID, date, time, and various status icons, including text message waiting, voice message waiting, battery and signal strength, and voice and message mail. There's even a blue backlight on the secondary display for nighttime viewing.</>The V600 sports well-placed, well-machined keys, and its compact size does nothing to hinder dialing even for large-fingered users. The solid scroll keys bring you to very intuitive menus presented nicely on a single screen, marked by functional but showier-than-necessary graphics. There are also dedicated external buttons for speaker volume, voice recording, and ring volume.</><B>Messaging and Internet</B><br> The advanced MMS capabilities built in to the V600 enable users to send, edit, forward, and receive image, text, audio, and video messages over the wireless Internet, to and from compatible phones or PCs. (Messages can run up to 100k in size.) You'll also get instant messaging capability, messaging templates, SMS two-way messaging, conventional email, and predictive text assistance. Beyond messaging, the V600's Internet connectivity lets you access online services such as stock quotes, road directions, airline information, entertainment, and more. You can also download Java applications (version CLDC 1.0, MIDP 2.0, 100k per application limit) for which the phone provides 5 MB total (shared) memory. High-speed data transfer and download round out the package. The V600 supports digital TTY/TDD functionality for the hearing impaired.</><B>Organizer</B><br> Organizer features include a calendar, calculator with currency converter, date book with event storage, and voice memo. You can also transfer this data to your PC wirelessly via the phone's Bluetooth capability.</>We found the V600's appointment scheduling to be right in line with our fairly basic needs. Other than the universal annoyance of pecking out appointment details with the ten-key letter system (there's no QWERTY keyboard here as you'll find on some of the more recent, albeit early-adopter phones) this phone's organizer features provided enough data entry space for any busy person taking these functions seriously, but no more.</><B>Fun and Games</B><br> For fun, the V600 sports a built-in 640 x 480 pixels integrated digital camera with zoom and brightness adjustment functions. Pictures taken with the camera can be stored in the phone or sent to others via multimedia messaging. The 5 MB of memory available for storing pictures is also shared with whatever wallpapers, screensavers, ring tones, Java applications, or games you may download from the Internet. The V600 also features 24 chord ring tone capability. Users can assign different tones for different callers in the V600's phonebook, and assign separate tones to denote incoming messages, faxes, and reminders. Wireless multiplayer gaming capabilities and two included games, ""Bejeweled"" and ""Stuntman"", round out the entertainment perks that ship with this phone.</><B>Conclusions</B><br> We liked this phone's very basic camera. It was easy to use and worry-free and the device can be accessed instantly from the phone's top level screen menu. From power on, it only took us a moment to take and save a fairly nice picture. However, photo quality is only adequate; about as good as you'd expect for a cell phone circa 2004, as opposed to a dedicated digital camera. We also found the ring tones included with the phone to be generally pleasant, and it was a breeze to assign a custom tone to a number in the phonebook, thanks again to the easy menu system. The included games were basic and fairly fun (at least once). In ""Stuntman"", the phone's vibrate mode provided road rumble as a little car skidded around a bland, full-color stunt course. But player beware! Once the game starts, the volume becomes LOUD and is not apparently adjustable. Finally, there is a nutty little feature called Motomixer, which lets you modify various settings on little songs that you can download, emulating a very rudimentary, miniature studio console.</>In all, we found the Motorola V600 to be a rock solid, highly effective cell phone with attractive and efficient graphic and audio capabilities. We recommend the V600 without reservations for any serious user.</><B>Vital Statistics</B><br> The Motorola V600's security features include call restrictions, phone lock, and new password capability.

Designed to enhance the experience of any Bluetooth technology enabled phone, the Motorola Wireless Headset HS850 also stores information and wirelessly interacts with up to eight different Bluetooth 1.1 and 1.2 compliant devices, including handsets, PDAs and computers. The Motorola HS850 Bluetooth Headset is in it's original condition. Product also includes original charger, warranty, and manual.</></>The Motorola HS850 is the company's update to their HS810 headset, one of my personal favorites. The changes made to produce the new HS850 are few, but the effect is relatively substantial. But first, let's start with what is the same.</>Like the HS810, the HS850 makes use of a body design that employs a folding microphone boom. The folding microphone boom acts as the on and off switch, as well as just providing a convenient way to make the headset smaller and more pocketable when not in use. When a call comes into your phone, you can turn on and answer the phone at the same time just by unfolding the microphone boom. You can end the call and turn it off by removing the headset and re-folding it. Using the headset in this way conserves battery power, since no battery juice is wasted on standby time - time where the headset sits around waiting to be contacted by a mobile phone or other compatible device. The physical design of the HS850 and the battery savings it imparts is my favorite aspect of the Motorola HS850.</>Of course you don't have to remove and turn off the headset between calls. If the headset is already on when an inbound call comes, you will hear the ringing come through on the headset and can answer it by pressing on the main multi-function call control button. You can end the call with this same button, and adjust volume levels with the two volume buttons. If you are using a phone that supports the Hands Free Bluetooth profile, then you can also use the call control button to reject an inbound call or redial the last number.</>The HS850's audio properties are also like those of the HS810 before it. The audio quality in both directions is very clear and understandable, but sounds a bit thin. You and the party on the other end of the call will both be able to understand each other easily, it just doesn't sound as full and natural as it might with some other headsets. The HS850 makes up for this small lacking by having great resistance to wind noise, though. That makes the headset perfect for people that enjoy driving with their windows down, or those that work outside. Most headsets are very susceptible to wind noise, the HS850 bucks that trend.</>And now for the new stuff. First up, a more powerful battery. The HS850 I tested managed an amazing 7 hours and 50 minutes of talk time. That is a full two thirds improvement over the older model. The truly amazing part is that this new battery life didn't come at the expense of added weight. Like the HS810 before it, the HS850 weighs only .7oz (19.9g).</>The next major change perhaps sounds more important than it worked out to be in reality. The HS850 supports the newer Bluetooth v1.2 spec, whereas most headsets support v1.1 only. Motorola claims that when used with a v1.2 compatible phone (there are still relatively few available at the time I write this), the HS850 will be able to connect faster, use less battery power, and offer improved audio quality. While I can see what appears to be a slight improvement in connection speed, I haven't really noticed much of a change in battery life or audio quality.</>The last major change is purely cosmetic. The new headset is sold in this very nice black color and is also available in <a href=""/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0007WWAGI/${0}"">blue-gray</a>, like a darker version of the HS810's color.

B0009FCAJA,Motorola,"The Moto Razr V3 is expertly crafted to deliver exceptional performance. Inside the ultra-thin design are advanced features like MPEG4 video playback, Bluetooth wireless technology, a digital camera and more. And with the precision-cut keypad, minimalist styling and metal finish, the V3 looks just as beautiful as it performs. The real difference is in the details. See who&#8217;s calling, in color, without opening your phone &#8212; the large internal display is complemented by an impressive external display. The precision-cut metal keypad reacts to the lightest of touches. And the features you can't always see are equally impressive, like quad-band GSM &#8212; for global calls where GSM network coverage and roaming agreements are present.</></>When the Motorola RAZR V3 was launched last year, I think most everybody, including Motorola itself, was quite surprised by how popular the handset turned out to be, considering the asking price. Its slim profile and sleek silver colored metal body proved to be just too much of a temptation for the world, and people the world over jumped through hoops and over hurdles just to get one for their very own. Everybody was a movie star with one of these!</>Until, of course, Motorola gave 50 exclusive RAZR V3 BLK handsets to some real movie stars at the 77th Annual Academy Awards in February, 2005. All of a sudden, the silver RAZR lost some of its shine. But once again, it is time for the masses to rejoice. Motorola is making the RAZR BLK available to all.</>Of course it isn't just the color that makes the RAZR V3 BLK such a desirable handset. One reason that people love it so is its size. It weighs only 3.35oz (95g), which is pretty light for a phone that has a largely metal body. At 3.86"" x 2.17"" x .57"" (98mm x 55mm x 14.5mm) in size, it is actually thinner than most candy bar style phones on the market. It can be slipped perfectly into a shirt, suit, or pants pocket, as well as a purse, without being noticed.</>There is so much more to the RAZR V3 BLK than its physical being, though. Certainly the primary purpose of any phone must be making phone calls, and in spite of its small stature, the RAZR V3 BLK managed a full 7 hours of talk time in our tests - a very respectable showing. A related bonus is the fact that you can charge the RAZR V3 BLK directly from your computer's USB port with the same type of mini-USB cable that you probably already have for your digital camera. That's one less power adapter to pack in the suitcase. Support for all 4 GSM frequency bands means that the RAZR will work in San Francisco and New York just as well as it will in Paris and London. The handset's internal antenna also proved to be quite capable, offering up very good reception in weak signal areas.</>Of course some compromises had to be made to get all of this functionality into such a small package. The keypad, for example, is a very thin metal unit that offers less tactile feedback than most, though it makes up for that somewhat by looking fantastic in the dark, thanks to its cool blue back light. While quite usable, it might take a bit of getting used to. No compromises were made with the main display, though: a nice 2.2"" 65k color TFT unit, with 176 x 220 pixel resolution. The external display is also color, though only a 4k CSTN type.</>The built-in VGA camera proved itself to be one of the better ones on the market, offering good contrast, color, and focus in most situations. The RAZR's polyphonic sound system also works quite well, and even allows you to use MP3 files as ringtones.

Logitech's Wireless MP3 Headphones allow you to listen to music wirelessly using advanced Bluetooth frequency-hopping technology. Bluetooth is the leading technology for transmitting and receiving wireless signals. When integrated into wireless headphones, the result is interference-free, crystal clear audio.

Just plug the included wireless adapter into your MP3 player (or any other 3.5mm headphone jack) and you're ready to listen to music anywhere. You can even place your player in another location and move freely around the room, because the headphones have a range of up to 30 feet! And with integrated controls right on the headphones, you can adjust the volume or mute song tracks without ever touching your MP3 player.

Although these headphones are designed with MP3 players in mind, you can also use them with your computer and enjoy wireless audio while playing your favorite game, watching a movie, or listening to music. Listen to audio privately from your PC or MAC even when you are away from the desk - without disturbing others around you! This set includes a dual charger for both the headphones and the Bluetooth adapter, and the integrated batteries have a charge life of up to eight hours.

Everything that's great about the Treo hardware is here, plus all the power of Windows Mobile 5.0. And to top it off, the Treo 700w is fully compatible with Verizon wireless' EV-DO mobile broadband data service.

The design retains the same basic form factor as the Treo 650 with a few changes. Aesthetically, the new Treo has more angular lines and a more professional-looking gray color. At 6 ounces, it's also slightly lighter than its predecessor. The button layout above the full QWERTY keyboard has been changed to accommodate the Windows Mobile 5.0 interface, and the screen sports 240 x 240 resolution.</>Like the 650, the top of the 700w features an expansion card slot for SD, SDIO, and MMC memory and expansion cards, and get this: Unlike the 650, the 700w supports the Palm Wi-Fi card. Up top there's also an infrared port for line of sight data transfers, as well as a handy switch for turning off the phone's ringer. Below the screen, a five-way navigator controls most of the phone's menus and operating system functions. The left side of the unit features a volume up/down toggle plus a handy user-customizable button that can be assigned to any phone or PDA function. The rear of the unit houses a loudspeaker, as well as the 1.3 megapixel camera unit. A touchscreen stylus can be tucked away on the right side of the phone. Meanwhile, a combined charging, data, and accessory attachment port, called the Palm ""multi-connector"" is housed on the bottom of the unit, as is a standard 2.5 mm stereo headset jack.</><B>Calling and PDA Features</B><br> Like the Treo 650, the Treo 700w's phone and PDA functions are designed to provide an integrated, seamless experience -- only this time its all handled by Windows Mobile. The hallmark of the Windows Mobile experience is the ""Today"" screen that summarizes all the important information you need to make it through the day. Here you'll get message notification, upcoming appointments, dialing functions, and a Google Web searching all in one spot.   As a phone, the Treo 700w features all the functionality folks expect from a cell phone, including a handsfree speakerphone, polyphonic ringtones (polyphonic MIDI, MP3, WAV and video ringtones are supported), a vibrate mode, and picture caller ID. Microsoft Office Outlook Mobile combines email, calendar, contacts, tasks, and notes into a single application that seamlessly integrates with the 700w's phone functions. Meanwhile, headsets, car kits and other wireless peripherals can also be paired with the unit via Bluetooth (the Bluetooth 1.2 specification is supported).</>Staying productive on the road is made possible by the Microsoft Office Mobile suite, which includes Word Mobile, Excel Mobile, and PowerPoint Mobile. You also get Picsel PDF Viewer for viewing PDF document attachments, and the File Explorer application makes it easy to browse the files on your 700w.</><B>Messaging and Internet</B><br> The really big news about the 700w is that it supports Verizon's BroadbandAccess high speed wireless data service, allowing you to get DSL speeds wherever you have broadband data coverage. And what can you do with all that speed? Surf the Web faster than ever before using the bundled Internet Explorer application, or log into Pocket MSN and check your Hotmail, use MSN Messenger, or browse the MSN Mobile portal. Robust SMS and MMS functionality is built into the Windows Mobile interface, too.</>One of the most important tools bundled with the 700w is Microsoft ActiveSync, which allows you to quickly synchronize your device's tasks, calendars, email, and contacts with your desktop. You also get Exchange ActiveSync, an application that lets you synchronize data with an Exchange server. Syncing can be done via USB, or wirelessly via Bluetooth.</><B>Imaging and Entertainment</B><br> Another great feature of the 700w is that it supports Windows Media playback right out of the box. With Windows Media Player 10, Palm users can finally play streaming and downloaded video and audio content in a variety of formats, even purchased music from ""Plays For Sure"" supporting stores. You can also keep your tunes loaded on a memory card and listen to stereo sound wherever you roam (requires an optional stereo headset adapter).</>The Treo 700w's built-in camera sees a bump in performance with the ability to take 1.3 megapixel (1280x1024) stills. The camera also features a 2x digital zoom, a self portrait mirror, and automatic light balancing. While the camera is great for taking stills, it can also function as a camcorder, allowing you to capture MPEG4 video to the unit's memory. An integrated media application organizes your captured photos and videos.</>And last, but certainly not least, the Treo 700w keeps the fun going when you've got some downtime with great games. Bubble Breaker and Solitaire ship with the handset, but more Windows Mobile games are available.</><B>Suggested Service Options</B><br> To get the most from the Treo 700w, you'll need to choose two additional service features on top of a voice plan. First, consider a Verizon BroadbandAccess plan, which also includes lower-speed data access in areas where broadband service is not available. If you are a frequent SMS or MMS messaging user, it's a good idea to get an Unlimited IN messaging plan to avoid pay-per-message charges.

B000EIXG7C,Motorola,"Complete with superior audio quality, unbeatable battery time and an ergonomic design, the Motorola RAZR H3 promises to keep all your communication needs at your fingertips. This headset is a perfect companion for the ultra thin Motorola RAZR V3 or a variety of Bluetooth 1.2 and 1.1 enabled mobile phones. Ergonomic, removable ear hook with improved back housing design to form fit to your ear to allow for the user to wear the headset on either ear.  3-way call conference -  Join 2 separate calls into conference with headset buttons   Advanced Volume controls -  adjust orientation of volume up button and also mute the headset   Blue LED light to notify when the headset is in use, can be turned off if preferred   Specifications -  Maximum Transmit Range 35 feet (10 m)   Battery Life -  Up to 10 Hours</></>The Motorola H3 Bluetooth headset is the company's ""RAZR"" headset, styled after the successful line of thin-profile mobile phones that has been taking the world by storm. The H3 is compatible with both Bluetooth v1.1 and Bluetooth v1.2 capable phones supporting the headset or hands free profiles. When paired with a v1.2 Bluetooth phone you can expect to hear slightly cleaner sound and experience faster connections.</>Our H3 weighed .67oz (19g), which is respectable. Its body is about 2.4"" (61mm) in length, and about 1.1"" (27mm) in width. The flip-out ear-loop extends out further, and can be reconfigured for use on either the left or right ear with little effort. There is a miniUSB power port on the end of the device that means the H3 can be charged with the included adapter or with a miniUSB cable connected to a laptop or desktop PC. For you road warriors out there, that can mean one less power adapter to carry with you on trips.</>Comfort wise, the H3 is about middle of the road. The inside edge of the ear loop has a grippy, rubber surface that helps keep it in place. The ear-loop itself is rather narrow, though, which when combined with the somewhat long body length of the H3 can make it a bit less stable and more prone to ""flapping"" than others when you turn your head left and right quickly. On the flip side, though, the ear loop is narrow enough to work with virtually any pair of eyeglasses.</>In terms of controls, there are only three buttons on the H3. On the top and bottom edge of the headset you will find one volume control each. When being worn, the headset button that faces up will raise the volume, and the bottom facing down will lower it. If you reconfigure the H3 for use on the other ear, it will notice that and reconfigure the buttons so that the up volume button still points up. The only other button on the Motorola H3 is the call button. It is also the only sore spot I have with the H3, since it requires too much pressure to activate. Pressure that can be annoying to sensitive ears. But other than that, the button works well enough and allows for control of all non-volume related features, such as redial, hold, and call end and start. If your phone supports voice dialing, you will be able to use the voice dialing with the H3 without having to touch your phone.</>Audio quality on the H3 is pretty good overall. The inbound audio is very good, and the outbound quality is perhaps a bit above average. The outbound audio has a nice full and natural sound to it, but lacks a bit of high frequency response that would make the speaker easier to understand, but still an overall pleasant sound. While the H3 is quite susceptible to a head wind (ie. wind blowing directly into your face), it does reasonably well with winds coming at it from a 90 degree angle. The noise suppression system in the H3 works rather well, and does a good job of reducing background noise without sacrificing too much of the quality of the speaker's voice.</><strong>Pros:</strong><br> <li>RAZR-like looks</li> <li>miniUSB power</li> <li>Good noise suppression</li> <li></li></><strong>Cons:</strong><br> <li>Susceptible to head winds</li> <li>Non-adjustable ear-loop</li></>While there are better performing headsets on the market, the H3's good looks and solid performance make it a nice match for one of Motorola's RAZR handsets, as well as many others on the market today. Its blue LED status indicator is cool looking (and can be disabled), and its 8 hours of talk time is quite respectable. The Motorola H3 is a solid Bluetooth v1.2 headset that deserves some serious consideration.","Compatible with Bluetooth 1.2 or 1.1 enabled mobile phones, PDAs, PCs and more,Enhanced audio performance,Up to eight hours of talk time or 150 hours of standby time from a single charge,Bluetooth 1.2 support provide quicker pairing, better audio with less dropped calls and reduced interference from other devices,Call button to control call start and end, hold and toggle between calls",Motorola Bluetooth Headset H3 (Black),0.0,100,Cell Phones,2.75

B000FYU4SO,Motorola,"Like new in box great looking phone get it before its gone !!</><blockquote><small><i>To keep your smartphone's applications up to date, and to optimize the performance of your device, you may need to perform firmware and/or software updates just as you would on your PC. To learn more about updates for your device, please visit <a href=""http://direct.motorola.com/ENS/q-user-support.asp?Country=USA&language=ENS&productid=30419"" target=""_blank"">Motorola's support site</a>. Note that by clicking this link you will be leaving Amazon.com.</i></small></blockquote>   Motorola's QWERTY keyboard equipped Q, formerly known as the RAZRberry in the rumor mills, might not exactly be the ""BlackBerry killer"" that many predicted, but it is certainly one of the most capable and user friendly smartphones available on the market today.</>Based on Microsoft's Windows Mobile 5.0 Smartphone platform, the Q picks up the best features from Microsoft's more phone oriented Smartphone edition of Windows Mobile while still offering a lot of PDA-like capability and screen real estate on its 65k color, 320x240 pixel display.</>In terms of hardware features, the Q's right side 3-way scroll wheel and dedicated back buttons take center stage.  These give the Q user fast BlackBerry-like scrolling with the ability to select an item or return to the prior screen - all with the user's thumb.  Of course you can still do these same things the traditional way by using the 5-way direction pad and the back button that sits to its right.  There's also a dedicated home key as well as the red and green call control keys.</>The Q's QWERTY keyboard is a bit stiff, but otherwise designed well.  The dark keys serve double duty as the numeric keypad when the Option key (found left of the Z key) is used.  The Option key can be locked on, as can the shift key on the opposite side of the keyboard.  Along the bottom of the keyboard you'll find dedicated buttons for email, the 1.3 megapixel camera, and a dual-use key for the speaker-independent voice dialing system and speakerphone.</>When it comes to hot features, though, the Q's EV-DO 3G data capability tops the list.  When used in an EV-DO coverage area, the Q user can expect to get wireless data rates that approach those enjoyed by home DSL users.  When there is no EV-DO coverage available, the Q will fall back to the slower 1xRTT data network (roughly comparable to a 56Kbps modem).  The Q can also connect to a desktop PC with a USB or Bluetooth connection.  Bluetooth can also be used with mono and stereo headsets, as well as other devices like keyboards.</>While WiFi wireless access would have been a welcomed feature, it would have only led to even more strain on the already overtaxed battery.  The standard capacity battery is capable of a respectable 5.5 hours of continuous talk time, but realistically will only provide a day of solid use, especially if the Q user takes advantage of the BlackBerry-like push email support.  The push system can keep your Q lock step in sync with your corporate or home email inbox without any user intervention required.  On top of email synchronization, it can also be used to synchronize the Q's contacts, calendar entries, tasks and other items with your home or office copy of Microsoft Outlook.  It is somewhat eerie how you can enter a new contact or appointment on the Q and have it show up moments later in Outlook - or the other way around.</>One of the great things about owning a smartphone is the ability to add 3rd party developed applications to the device.  Since Windows Mobile 5.0 is quite popular, there are plenty such applications available both freely and for purchase.  The Q has about 50MB of RAM for running applications, and a similar amount for storing data and the applications themselves.  If you need more storage space, you can easily add a gigabyte or two by inserting a miniSD memory card into the Q's slot, located on the left edge of the device.</>The Motorola Q packs a lot of capability into a device that is only a half inch thick and weighs 4.3 ounces - considerably less than the competition.  It comes highly recommended.</><b>Pros:</b><br> <ul><li>One-handed use</li> <li>Thin and light</li> <li>EV-DO data</li> </ul></><b>Cons:</b><br> <ul><li>Short standby battery life</li> <li>Stiff keyboard keys</li> </ul>",,Motorola Moto Q - Smartphone - CDMA2000 1X - bar - Windows Mobile - silver - Verizon,17.99,100,Cell Phones,3.375

Capture PIX and FLIX with the 1.3 megapixel camera, or record your own full length videos.</>Get ready for the power of Verizon's exciting V Cast service, which allows you to download or stream full motion video and 3D games, all on your handset. A service like that requires some horsepower, and luckily, the LG VX8300 is up for the task. And that includes support for Verizon Wireless' exciting music service, which lets you discover and jam out to tunes wherever you roam.</>This upgrade to the popular VX8100 adds a thinner and lighter profile, much longer battery life, and support for stereo Bluetooth headsets and microSD memory cards instead of miniSD. As with the VX8100, the VX8300 features a 1.3 megapixel camera with video capture and dual color displays. All this makes the VX8300 the perfect companion in a new era of high-speed wireless content.</><B>Design</B><br> The VX8300 features a traditional clamshell design with a very large 176 x 220 color display and support for a whopping 262,000 colors-- plenty of room for V Cast content.

Ringtones can be assigned to specific callers so you don't have to look at the phone to know who's calling, or you can match pictures with callers to identify them. The VX8300's voice recognition software supports voice commands from any user, not just a pre-programmed user's voice. Lastly, the VX8300's GPS location technology pinpoints your exact location when you dial 911.</><B>Messaging, Internet and Tools</B><br> With support for the EV-DO high-speed data standard, the VX8300 is fully compatible with Verizon's V Cast service.

Verizon's Get It Now wireless download service is also fully compatible with the VX8300. This pay-per-download service features application downloads, games and productivity tools. You can also personalize your handset with ringtone downloads using the Get It Now service.</>Verizon's music service is another EV-DO-powered service that makes the VX8300 all the more desirable. With V Cast Music, your phone is a music player, letting you jam out wherever you are. It's also a music store, and you can download songs instantly to your phone wirelessly. Save your songs to a memory card with a capacity that's right for you. You can even pause to take a call without missing a beat.</>The VX8300 ships with a number of handy tools including a calendar and a voice memo application. An alarm clock and calculator are also included. Use the VX8300's Bluetooth capability to set up a wireless link with a Bluetooth headset accessory or connect to a computer or hand-held device to exchange and synchronize data. And don't forget that you can take advantage of the VX8300's support for Bluetooth stereo headsets.</><B>Imaging and Entertainment</B> <br> While the VX8300 is a great platform for watching V Cast video content, it can also capture video that can be shared with your friends and associates via video messaging. The video unit records in MPEG4 format and can capture clips up to 15 seconds in length. Of course, you can also use the camera to capture still pictures, too. In addition to megapixel resolution (1280 x 960), the camera features an LED flash, macro and night modes, a self-timer, and brightness and white balance controls.</>The VX8300 supports V Cast 3D games, as well as other 2D-based games, which are available from Verizon's Get It Now service.

The K790a's two-inch screen sports a whopping 240x320 pixel resolution with support for 262,000 colors.

Sony Ericsson also provides a free picture blogging feature, which allows you to upload pictures from your phone to a place where all your friends and family can view them online.</>The K790a is also a great music phone.

B0000D9N38,igourmet,"Produced in La Mancha in Central Spain, true Manchego is made from 100% sheep's milk. Cheeses from Spain are commonly made from sheep's milk because most of the territory is rocky and dry; unfriendly to cows but suitable for raising goats and sheep. The abundance of wild herbs on Central Spain's grazing lands gives Manchego a special taste and aroma. Its flavor is zesty and exuberant, while its texture is firm, but not dry. Manchego can be recognized by the zigzag pattern etched into its rind. This is created by the rippled surface of the press used in the production of the cheese. Underneath the inedible rind, the interior is ivory-colored with few small holes. Taste Manchego for the first time and you will be surprised at how long the wonderful flavor lingers on your palate. It is an experience you will be drawn back to again and again.</>Pasteurized manchega's sheep milk, rennet, cheese culture, salt, lysozyme from egg white</>Statements regarding dietary supplements have not been evaluated by the FDA and are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or health condition.",,Manchego - Pound Cut (1 pound),17.97,100,Grocery,4.5

Today the same technique is used with the combination of cabbage, salt, and spices allowing the mixture to ferment.</>Since the classical period, cabbage has been valued for its healing properties.

B0000DG86X,Brussel's Bonsai,"</>Considered a very hardy conifer, the Juniper is a non-flowering tree that makes a great choice for bonsai because of it is so easy to prune and train. Originating from China, it is one of the most popular types of bonsai trees and is a firm favorite of many bonsai enthusiasts. The Juniper is a low growing plant, producing lush greenery and small, firm, silvery blue berries atop interesting bark that adapts well to several creative forms of Bonsai bark manipulation. This type of tree offers the choice of being able to grow it indoors or outdoors. Its compact foliage makes it one of the best candidates to become a Bonsai. Junipers grow slowly and are very long-lived. This Juniper will grow with outstanding beauty, remaining green throughout the year.</>Each live plant is shipped with the Phytosanitary Certificate as required by the USDA.</>The natural movement of the Green Mound's trunk and branches captures the essential grace and beauty of bonsai. A hardy, outdoor evergreen, this low-maintenance juniper is one of the easiest bonsai for beginners. This tree is five years old and 8 to 12 inches tall. Every tree order includes specific growing instructions.</><b>Delivery and Packaging: What to expect when you receive your bonsai </b><br> To ensure only well-established, healthy trees are shipped, Brussel's Bonsai imports its trees from nurseries in China where growers spend years training and shaping tree branches. Some bonsai defoliate (drop leaves) when their environment changes. If upon the tree's arrival some leaves have dropped or turned slightly brown that does not mean the bonsai is unhealthy. Defoliation is the natural result of being in the low-light environment of a shipping box. Whenever possible, Brussels Bonsai avoids using Styrofoam-popcorn packaging. In some cases, Styrofoam popcorn must be used to safely pack unusually shaped bonsai. Organic popcorn packaging made from corn starch reacts with moisture from the trees and can dissolve. When you receive your tree, place the box in a shaded area to unpack. Inspect tree for damage to branches or leaves. Water soil if dry. Place each bonsai in protected shade for at least one week before moving to a sunny location.</><b>What is a Bonsai?</b><br> Literally, the Japanese word ""bonsai"" means ""tray tree"" or ""plant grown in a pot."" The term refers to the artistic techniques used to capture the natural beauty of trees, rather than a specific variety of tree. A full-grown tree and a bonsai can be grown from the same seed--the bonsai has simply been dwarfed and shaped through years of training. To develop authentic bonsai, Brussels grows specimens under carefully controlled conditions, meticulously training each tree with wire and pruning over a period of years. The value of a particular bonsai typically depends on size, age, and training. Generally, more expensive trees are larger, older, and have had more detailed, elaborate training. These qualities combined create the illusion of a large tree in a natural setting.</><b>Deciduous/Outdoor Bonsai Care</b></><b><i>Climate</i></b><br> Outdoor bonsai are deciduous trees that require the same climate changes in spring, summer, fall, and winter as full-sized trees of the same species. As a rule, deciduous bonsai do well in regions with humidity levels of 50% to 75% and yearly temperature ranges of 20 to 100 degree F. During winter, deciduous bonsai must remain outdoors. This period of dormancy is essential--without it, the tree may become unhealthy and susceptible to disease. Protect or ""heel-in"" your bonsai by covering the pot and soil with pine needles or mulch. Place the tree against a wall to shield it from extreme winds. Outdoor bonsai are more vulnerable to extreme cold than full-size trees and should be moved to a garage, shed, cold frame, or basement when temperatures fall below 20 degrees F.</><table> <table width=""0%"" border=""0"" cellpadding=""7"" align=""left""> <tr> <td> <img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/outdoorliving/display6sm.jpg""> </td> </tr> </table> <b><i>Placement</i></b><br> Deciduous bonsai need to be kept outdoors year-round. Natural sunlight and rainwater are both important elements in an ideal growing environment. Typically, they require six or more hours of direct sunlight a day and do well in locations that get shade from late afternoon sun. Outdoor bonsai may be displayed indoors once a month, for short periods of time (2-3 days). In Japan, bonsai are traditionally displayed against a solid black, white, wood, or bamboo background, or on a stand or pot larger than the tree. Stark contrasts enhance the bonsais simple beauty.</><table> <table width=""0%"" border=""0"" cellpadding=""7"" align=""right""> <tr> <td> <img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/outdoorliving/water2.jpg""> </td> </tr> </table> <b><i>Watering</i></b><br> Generally speaking, water when the top of the soil is dry. Use a can or hose attachment that casts a soft, rain-like spray that wont disturb the soil in the pot. Do not allow bonsai to dry out. Water daily during hot summer months. In winter, though trees need less water, its a good idea to water well before a hard freeze (frozen water acts as insulation).</><b><i>Soil and fertilizer</i></b><br> Bonsai trees spend years in the same soil and eventually deplete the available nutrients. Providing supplemental nutrition is essential for a healthy tree. Most water soluble and time-released fertilizers work well when used as directed.</><table> <table width=""0%"" border=""0"" cellpadding=""7"" align=""right""> <tr> <td> <img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/outdoorliving/pot1sm.jpg""> </td> <tr><td> <i><font size=-1><b>Run wire through drain</b></font></i></td></tr> </tr> <td> <img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/outdoorliving/pot3tiny2.jpg""> </td><tr><td> <i><font size=-1><b>Trim rootball</b></font></i></td></tr> </tr> </tr> <tr> <td> <img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/outdoorliving/pot6tiny.jpg""> </td> <tr><td> <i><font size=-1><b>Work soil into roots</b></font></i></td></tr> </tr> </tr> </table> <b><i>Repotting</i></b><br> Bonsai need to be repotted every 3 to 5 years. After receiving your tree, wait at least one growing season before repotting. Using proper bonsai soil is critical. Brussels bonsai soil consists of a mixture of high-fired clay particles and finely ground pine bark. The soil-free mix does not compact, allows water to drain easily, and helps prevent the root rot that often occurs with ordinary potting soil.</>It is important to pot your bonsai correctly. Prepare your container for potting by putting screen over the drain holes. Run wire through the drain screen--you will need this to secure the tree in the container. Trim the rootball so it will fit in the bonsai pot. Keep in mind, cutting larger roots is better than cutting small feeder roots. Continue trimming the root ball until it will fit into the bonsai container. Be sure to place a good layer of bonsai soil on the bottom of the bonsai container.</>Place the tree in the pot. Use the wire to secure the tree in the bonsai container. Twist and pull the wire with pliers to tighten. Add bonsai soil around the root ball. Use a chopstick to work the bonsai soil into the root system. Your bonsai should now be secure in its new container.</><table> <table width=""0%"" border=""0"" cellpadding=""7"" align=""left""> <tr> <td> <img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/outdoorliving/wire1sm.jpg""> </td> </tr> </table> <b><i>Training</i></b><br> All bonsai require some degree of seasonal pruning. Regular pruning produces smaller branches. A simple pair of pointed-nose scissors does the job. Wiring may also be used to hold them in a desired position or location. If youre happy with the branch placement as is, there is no real need to wire. For detailed instruction in the art of pruning bonsai, Brussels Bonsai recommends purchasing a book on basic training techniques.</>If you choose to wire your bonsai, make sure to use heavier gauge wire for larger branches on the bottom of the tree, and lighter gauge for smaller branches. Begin by sticking the end of the wire into the soil next to the trunk of the tree. Wrap the wire around the trunk until you come to the first branch. Continue curling the wire around the branch. Once you have come to the end of a branch, cut and remove the excess wire. The wire now allows you to bend the branch into the desired shape and location.</><b><i>Lifespan</i></b><br> Most bonsai trees can live up to 100 years or more depending, of course, on the quality of care they receive.</><b>The Story of Brussel's Bonsai Nursery</b><br> When Brussel Martin was five years old, he was instantly captivated by several bonsai his father brought back from a California business trip. As a teenager, he began to seriously study the art of bonsai. What started as an artistic endeavor in his parents' backyard quickly grew into a business. In the 1970s, he began selling bonsai through the mail and traveling to shows across the country. By the early '80s, he was making annual buying trips to Asia.</>As the business has grown, so has his desire to introduce bonsai to more and more Americans. Brussels now offers a full range of bonsai trees, from modestly priced bonsai for the beginner to unique specimens styled by bonsai experts.","CONTENTS: Bonsai, Decorative Container (Assorted Colors & Styles), Soil, Care Instructions.,SPECIES: The Juniper is a low growing plant, producing lush greenery and small, firm, silvery blue berries atop interesting bark that adapts well to several creative forms of Bonsai bark manipulation.,AGE/SIZE/CARE: Your medium 5 year old bonsai will arrive at 6"" to 10"" tall in a 8"" container and will perform best outdoors (see detailed care instructions in images),USES: Ideal Mothers Day gift, office & cubicle dcor or a centerpiece for any kitchen table, desktop, window plant or outdoor dcor.,WARRANTY: Your bonsai tree has been grown in a state-of-the-art greenhouse under precisely controlled conditions to achieve optimum health.

The needles are deciduous and quite pretty in the fall when the airy light green spray turns to yellow and then to bronze before shedding from the trees. Redwood Bonsai trees make wonderful sights and this can be attributed to the way in which the Redwood tapers away from its root flare which is broad and heavy.

Use a can or hose attachment that casts a soft, rain-like spray that wont disturb the soil in the pot. Do not allow bonsai to dry out. Water daily during hot summer months. In winter, though trees need less water, its a good idea to water well before a hard freeze (frozen water acts as insulation).</><b><i>Soil and fertilizer</i></b><br> Bonsai trees spend years in the same soil and eventually deplete the available nutrients. Providing supplemental nutrition is essential for a healthy tree. Most water soluble and time-released fertilizers work well when used as directed.</><table> <table width=""0%"" border=""0"" cellpadding=""7"" align=""right""> <tr> <td> <img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/outdoorliving/pot1sm.jpg""> </td> <tr><td> <i><font size=-1><b>Run wire through drain</b></font></i></td></tr> </tr> <td> <img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/outdoorliving/pot3tiny2.jpg""> </td><tr><td> <i><font size=-1><b>Trim rootball</b></font></i></td></tr> </tr> </tr> <tr> <td> <img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/outdoorliving/pot6tiny.jpg""> </td> <tr><td> <i><font size=-1><b>Work soil into roots</b></font></i></td></tr> </tr> </tr> </table> <b><i>Repotting</i></b><br> Bonsai need to be repotted every 3 to 5 years. After receiving your tree, wait at least one growing season before repotting. Using proper bonsai soil is critical. Brussels bonsai soil consists of a mixture of high-fired clay particles and finely ground pine bark. The soil-free mix does not compact, allows water to drain easily, and helps prevent the root rot that often occurs with ordinary potting soil.</>It is important to pot your bonsai correctly. Prepare your container for potting by putting screen over the drain holes. Run wire through the drain screen--you will need this to secure the tree in the container. Trim the rootball so it will fit in the bonsai pot. Keep in mind, cutting larger roots is better than cutting small feeder roots. Continue trimming the root ball until it will fit into the bonsai container. Be sure to place a good layer of bonsai soil on the bottom of the bonsai container.</>Place the tree in the pot. Use the wire to secure the tree in the bonsai container. Twist and pull the wire with pliers to tighten. Add bonsai soil around the root ball. Use a chopstick to work the bonsai soil into the root system. Your bonsai should now be secure in its new container.</><table> <table width=""0%"" border=""0"" cellpadding=""7"" align=""left""> <tr> <td> <img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kitchen/detailpages/outdoorliving/wire1sm.jpg""> </td> </tr> </table> <b><i>Training</i></b><br> All bonsai require some degree of seasonal pruning. Regular pruning produces smaller branches. A simple pair of pointed-nose scissors does the job. Wiring may also be used to hold them in a desired position or location. If youre happy with the branch placement as is, there is no real need to wire. For detailed instruction in the art of pruning bonsai, Brussels Bonsai recommends purchasing a book on basic training techniques.</>If you choose to wire your bonsai, make sure to use heavier gauge wire for larger branches on the bottom of the tree, and lighter gauge for smaller branches. Begin by sticking the end of the wire into the soil next to the trunk of the tree. Wrap the wire around the trunk until you come to the first branch. Continue curling the wire around the branch. Once you have come to the end of a branch, cut and remove the excess wire. The wire now allows you to bend the branch into the desired shape and location.</><b><i>Lifespan</i></b><br> Most bonsai trees can live up to 100 years or more depending, of course, on the quality of care they receive.</><b>The Story of Brussel's Bonsai Nursery</b><br> When Brussel Martin was five years old, he was instantly captivated by several bonsai his father brought back from a California business trip. As a teenager, he began to seriously study the art of bonsai. What started as an artistic endeavor in his parents' backyard quickly grew into a business. In the 1970s, he began selling bonsai through the mail and traveling to shows across the country. By the early '80s, he was making annual buying trips to Asia.</>As the business has grown, so has his desire to introduce bonsai to more and more Americans. Brussels now offers a full range of bonsai trees, from modestly priced bonsai for the beginner to unique specimens styled by bonsai experts.","CONTENTS: Bonsai, Decorative Container (Assorted Colors & Styles), Soil, Care Instructions.,SPECIES: The original Dawn Redwood Bonsai trees are hearty conifers that have a lacey type of needled foliage on gracefully upswept branches.
